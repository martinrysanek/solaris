Pokud v článku není žádná dobrá odpověď, řekněte \"nevím\".\nČlánek: \nKvantový počítač je počítač, který využívá kvantově mechanické jevy. V malých měřítkách vykazuje fyzikální hmota vlastnosti částic i vln a kvantové počítače využívají tohoto chování, konkrétně kvantové superpozice a provázanosti, pomocí specializovaného hardwaru, který podporuje přípravu a manipulaci s kvantovými stavy. Klasická fyzika nedokáže vysvětlit fungování těchto kvantových zařízení a škálovatelný kvantový počítač by mohl provádět některé výpočty exponenciálně rychleji než jakýkoli moderní \"klasický\" počítač. Rozsáhlý kvantový počítač by zejména mohl prolomit široce používaná šifrovací schémata a pomoci fyzikům při provádění fyzikálních simulací; současný stav techniky je však převážně experimentální a nepraktický, přičemž užitečným aplikacím brání několik překážek. Škálovatelné kvantové počítače navíc nejsou pro mnoho praktických úloh perspektivní a u mnoha důležitých úloh je kvantové zrychlení prokazatelně nemožné. Základní jednotkou informace v kvantové výpočetní technice je qubit, podobně jako bit v tradiční digitální elektronice. Na rozdíl od klasického bitu může qubit existovat v superpozici svých dvou \"základních\" stavů, což volně znamená, že se nachází v obou stavech současně. Při měření qubitu je výsledkem pravděpodobnostní výstup klasického bitu, proto jsou kvantové počítače obecně nedeterministické. Pokud kvantový počítač manipuluje s qubitem určitým způsobem, mohou vlnové interferenční efekty zesílit požadované výsledky měření. Návrh kvantových algoritmů zahrnuje vytvoření postupů, které umožní kvantovému počítači provádět výpočty efektivně a rychle. Fyzikální inženýrství vysoce kvalitních qubitů se ukázalo jako náročné. Pokud není fyzický qubit dostatečně izolován od svého okolí, trpí kvantovou dekoherencí, která do výpočtů vnáší šum. Paradoxně je dokonalá izolace qubitů také nežádoucí, protože při kvantových výpočtech je obvykle třeba qubity inicializovat, provádět řízené interakce qubitů a měřit výsledné kvantové stavy. Každá z těchto operací přináší chyby a trpí šumem a tyto nepřesnosti se kumulují.",

Moneta zvýšila svůj výhled čistého zisku pro rok 2023 s výsledky za třetí kvartál 2023 na 5,0 mld. Kč z předchozích nejméně 4,7 mld. Kč. Management uvedl, že střednědobý výhled se reviduje a aktualizace bude vydána s prezentací celoročních výsledků. Zatímco výhled provozního zisku na rok 2024 by mohl být upraven níže, výhled čistého zisku ve výši minimálně 4,8 mld. Kč by měl zůstat nezměněn. Moneta se bude snažit pokles úrokových výnosů z titulu zrušení úročení minimálních rezerv ČNB kompenzovat silnějším a výnosnějším růstem vkladů, ale i úvěrů. Možností je i snížení nákladů management vidí prostor v roce 2024 pro cca ~100 mil. Kč) a pomoci by mohly i nižší než dříve předpokládané rizikové náklady.  Nedávné snížení požadavku SREP na rok 2024 a předchozí snížení proticyklické kapitálové rezervy zvýšilo přebytečný kapitál očekávaný pro rok 2023. Management uvedl, že zváží různé možnosti pro přebytečný kapitál.

The insured discovered the damage later and reported the incident to the police. The insured is filing a claim for the repairs and is providing the police report as evidence of the hit and run incident.",
         "The insured vehicle, a Tesla Model S, was parked outside on April 15th, 2023 when an unexpected and violent hailstorm struck the area. Hailstones of varying sizes, ranging from small pellets to large golf balls, rained down on the vehicle with relentless force. The impact of the hailstones caused extensive damage to the exterior of the vehicle, leaving behind a multitude of dents and dings on the roof, hood, trunk, and all sides. The hailstones were so powerful that they shattered the windshield and side windows, resulting in shattered glass fragments scattered throughout the interior of the vehicle. The insured immediately contacted their insurance company to report the incident and initiated the claims process. Recognizing the severity of the damage, the insurance company promptly dispatched an experienced auto appraiser to assess the extent of the hail damage. The appraiser meticulously inspected the vehicle, documenting each dent, ding, and broken window. Based on their assessment, the appraiser estimated the cost of repairs, taking into account the need for paintless dent removal, panel replacements, windshield replacement, and window repairs. With the appraisal report in hand, the insured is now filing a comprehensive claim for the necessary repairs. Along with the report, the insured is submitting detailed photographs of the damaged vehicle from multiple angles, capturing the extent of the hail damage.The insured understands the importance of providing compelling evidence to support their claim and has meticulously documented the damage. They are also including any additional information or documentation requested by the insurance company. The insured is eagerly awaiting the outcome of their claim, hopeful that the insurance company will process it promptly.They recognize that the repairs required to restore their beloved Tesla Model S to its pre-hailstorm condition will be extensive and costly. However, they have confidence in the insurance company's commitment to providing the necessary coverage and support. Their ultimate goal is to see their vehicle restored to its original beauty and performance, ready to hit the road once again, unaffected by the devastating hailstorm.",

The insured driver was waiting at a red light when another vehicle failed to stop and collided with the rear of the insured vehicle. The accident caused damage to the bumper and trunk of the insured vehicle.
